							<h2>Third Workshop on Recommender Systems in Fashion</h2>
							<p>15th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems,
							<br> Amsterdam, Netherlands, 27th September-1st October 2021</p>
						
							<p>Online Fashion retailers have significantly increased in popularity over the last decade, making it possible for customers to explore hundreds of thousands of products without the need to visit multiple stores or stand in long queues for checkout. However, the customers still face several hurdles with current online shopping solutions.  For example, customers often feel overwhelmed with the large selection of the assortment and brands. In addition, there is still a lack of effective suggestions capable of satisfying customers’ style preferences, or size and fit needs, necessary to enable them in their decision-making process. Moreover, in recent years social shopping in fashion has surfaced, thanks to platforms such as Instagram, providing a very interesting opportunity that allows to explore fashion in radically new ways. Such recent developments provides exciting challenges for Recommender Systems and Machine Learning research communities.
							</p>

							<p>This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners in the fashion, recommendations and machine learning domains to discuss open problems in the aforementioned areas. This involves addressing interdisciplinary problems with all of the challenges it entails. Within this workshop we aim to start the conversation among professionals in the fashion and e-commerce industries and recommender systems scientists, and create a new space for collaboration between these communities necessary for tackling these deep problems. To provide rich opportunities to share opinions and experience in such an emerging field, we will accept paper submissions on established and novel ideas, as well as new interactive participation formats.</p>

								<h3>Keynote Speaker, Julian McAuley </h3>
								<h4>
									"Fashion Recommender Systems: Some old tasks, some new tasks, and some emerging challenges"
								</h4>	
								
								<p>
									Abstract: In this talk I'll give a high-level overview of the history and some of the emerging problems at the intersection of recommendation and fashion. We'll start by introducing some of the "traditional" approaches to fashion recommendation, and discuss the main challenges involved in handling complex visual data, dealing with temporal signals, collecting reliable ground-truth (etc.). Next we'll talk about some of the unique problems in fashion that don't fall into usual recommendation paradigms, such as wardrobe recommendation, size estimation (etc.). Finally, we'll discuss some of the emerging trends in this area, especially focusing on fairness and bias issues in fashion recommendation data.	
								</p>

								<p>
									Bio: Julian McAuley has been a professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of California, San Diego since 2014. Previously he was a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University after receiving his PhD from the Australian National University in 2011. His research is concerned with developing predictive models of human behavior using large volumes of online activity data.
